    "About": "I am a PhD student at the University of California, San Diego, advised by [[Gerald Soosairaj]], [[Leo Porter]], and [[Bill Griswold]]. My research interests center on teaching practices, equitable course design, and culturally responsive pedagogy in computer science. Specifically, I am investigating how we can structure our courses and teaching to better support all students. I am also interested in anything regarding teaching assistants. Prior to joining UCSD, I taught and organized a range of undergraduate computer science courses at Duke University as an instructor of record, teaching associate, and graduate teaching assistant.",
